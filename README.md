<h1 align="center">Database Design and Implementation Project Report</h1>
<h2 align="left"> Project Objective </h2>

<h4 align="left">The aim of this project is to develop the skills of relational database design and implementation. A game database was designed for this purpose. This database consists of six main tables: players, levels, characters, items, friends and character items, and logical relationships between these tables. </h4>

<h2 align="left"> Database Design </h2>
<h4 align="left"> The design of our database consists of the following tables: </h4>

<h4 align="left">
  
- Player Contains information about the players.
  
- Level: Contains information about the game levels. 
  
- Item: Contains information about the items in the game. 
  
- Friend: Contains information about players' friendship relationships. 
  
- Character: Contains information about players' characters. 
  
- Character_Item: Contains information about the items owned by the characters. </h4>

<h4 align="left">Each table is designed for a specific purpose and has logical relationships between the tables. For example, the Character table is related to the Player, Level and Character_Item tables. This allows us to determine which player a character belongs to, what level it is and what items it has.</h4>

<h2 align="left"> Trigger </h2>
<h4 align="left"> Before adding data to the tables, trigger definitions were made first because there will be tables affected by data entry.</h4>

<h4 align="left"> A trigger that increases the user's friend_count when a friend is added to the Friend table.  </h4>

<h4 align="left"> A trigger that increments the item_count value from the Character table when data is added to the Character_item table. </h4>

<h2 align="left"> Data Entry </h2>

<h4 align="left"> For each table, the rand() function and loops are used to add the desired number of data. </h4>

<h4> For example, a data is added to the Character_Item table and since we created a trigger beforehand, the item_count value of the Character with the related character_id will also increase as a result of this addition.  </h4>

<h2 align="left"> Stored Procedure </h2>

<h4> A procedure that returns all characters of the requested Player</h4>

<h4> When running the procedure, we run the procedure by giving the desired player_id value. </h4>

<h4>And when executed, we can see the properties of all the characters of the Player whose player_id value we queried.</h4>

<h2>View</h2>

<h4> We created the desired properties of the characters that each player in the database has as a view.</h4>

<h4>This way keeps 100.000 data in the view.</h4>

<h2> SQL Query Examples </h2>

<h4> Query1 : shows the highest level characters of the Player whose player_id is queried... </h4>

<h4>Query2 : Find the 3 characters with the highest level among all players.</h4>

<h3>Query4 : Player with the highest total_score </h4>
